Main working experimental physics repo

All current work is withing the 'Working' folder, which includes scripts that are actively called from and/or scripts under development.

The 'Extractables' folder within this contains scripts with callable functions which perform well-known calculations.

The individual model folders for different bodies contain the data and plotting scripts for analysing the work produced in the main working folder.
