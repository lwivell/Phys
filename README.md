Main working experimental physics repo

All current work is withing the 'Working' folder, which includes scripts that are actively called from and/or scripts under development.

'Extractables' folder contains scripts with callable functions which perform well-known calculations.

'Json Models' is a folder that contains induction and spherical harmonic models to be loaded

'Enceladus/Europa Models' are folders that store the .npy files of run simulations and contain plotting/comparison scripts

The individual model folders for different bodies contain the data and plotting scripts for analysing the work produced in the main working folder.
